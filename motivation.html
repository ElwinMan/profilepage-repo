                    Motivation is a condition inside of us that desires a change
                    <br><br>
                    According to Kendra Cherry who wrote "What Is Motivation" on the page from VeryWellMind.<br>
                    There are 2 kinds of motivation:<br>
                </p>
                <ul class="apaFont">
                    <li> <b><u>Extrinsic motivations</u></b> are those that arise from outside of the individual and often involve rewards such as trophies, money, social recognition, or praise.</li>
                    <li><b><u>Intrinsic motivations</u></b> are those that arise from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword puzzle purely for the personal gratification of solving a problem.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="apaFont">
                    According to Dan Pink. <br>
                    Science shows that intrinsic motivations give higher preformance and creativity then extrinsic motivations.
                    By giving rewards for doing tasks (extrinsic motivations) makes your view on the task narrow,
                    which prevent the creativity that you need to have a higher performance.<br>
                    So if you want your employees have better performance, you need to give them intrinsic motivations.
                </p>
                <ul class="apaFont">
                    <li><b><u>Autonomy</u></b> the urge to direct our own lives.</li>
                    <li><b><u>Mastery</u></b> the desire to get better and better at something that matters.</li>
                    <li><b><u>Purpose</u></b> the yearning to do what we do in the service larger than ourselves.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="apaFont">
                    Giving your employees a part of their working time to make something else that they like to do
                    Instead of a project that they have been given to work on. Increases their creativity and performance.
