                    Motivation is a condition inside of us that desires a change
                    <br><br>
                    <b>According to Kendra Cherry</b><br>
                    who wrote "What Is Motivation" on the page from VeryWellMind.<br>
                    There are 2 kinds of motivation:<br>
                </p>
                <ul class="apaFont">
                    <li> <b>Extrinsic motivations</b> are those that arise from outside of the individual and often involve rewards such as trophies, money, social recognition, or praise.</li>
                    <li><b>Intrinsic motivations</b> are those that arise from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword puzzle purely for the personal gratification of solving a problem.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="apaFont">
                    <b>According to Dan Pink.</b> <br>
                    Science shows that intrinsic motivations give higher preformance and creativity then extrinsic motivations.
                    By giving rewards for doing tasks (extrinsic motivations) makes your view on the task narrow,
                    which prevent the creativity that you need to have a higher performance.<br>
                    So if you want your employees have better performance, you need to give them intrinsic motivations.
                </p>
                <ul class="apaFont">
                    <li><b>Autonomy</b> the urge to direct our own lives.</li>
                    <li><b>Mastery</b> the desire to get better and better at something that matters.</li>
                    <li><b>Purpose</b> the yearning to do what we do in the service larger than ourselves.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="apaFont">
                    Giving your employees a part of their working time to make something else that they like to do
                    Instead of a project that they have been given to work on. Increases their creativity and performance.

                    "You are quite both intrinsic and extrinsic motivated which means you find it quite fun to study, but sometimes
                    you dont."</b><br>
                    I agree with this, I don't like to study in general but for programming its quite fun to study.<br><br>
                    <b>"That you are quite extrinsic motivated means that you also take into account what you accomplish with your study."</b><br>
                    I also agree with this, ofcourse I want to accomplish things like a good job with my study and earn enough money to not having to worry about it.<br><br>
                    <b>"There is nothing wrong with your motivation, but you might be happier with a study that fits your interests more."</b><br>
                    I dont agree with this, I think the study I am in right now fits me and I'm happy with this study.</p>

                <p class="apaFont"><b>Independance (21 points)</b><br>
                I like to work alone alot, because of my personality (introvert).<br><br>
                <b>Certainty (18 points)</b><br>
                When I am a adult I would like to live a stable life.<br><br>
                <b>Status (3 points)</b><br>
                I don't really care about status, I just want to be happy and earn enough money to live my life without having to worry about money.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="apaFont"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                <p class="apaFont">I am quite both intrinsic and extrinsic motivated to study and for my study behavior,
                    I don't ask questions to teachers unless it's necessary because of my introvert personality.
                    In the future I just want to life happy and don't have to worry about money.</p>
